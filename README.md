Authentication
This application implements Online and Offline authentication for Shopify:

Offline Authentication: Used exclusively for the initial installation of the application in a store. It ensures the app can remain authorized even if a user logs out, making it ideal for background tasks and long-term access.

Online Authentication: Used whenever data needs to be loaded on the frontend, offering a session-based, user-specific token. This provides a more secure, temporary session for data interactions during the user's active session.

Shopify Recommendation: Use offline auth for installation and online auth for secure data interactions on the frontend. This setup adheres to Shopifyâ€™s security and data management guidelines, ensuring optimal app performance and data handling.

Environment Variables
Set up the following environment variables in both frontend/.env and backend/.env files:

Backend
```
SHOPIFY_API_KEY: Your Shopify API Key
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET: Your Shopify API Secret
SHOPIFY_SCOPES: Permissions required, e.g., read_products,write_products
SHOPIFY_REDIRECT_URI: Redirect URL for authentication
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN: Store access token for the app (for persistent access)

```
